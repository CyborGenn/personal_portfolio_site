personal_portfolio_site
=======================

This is a website using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/jQuery, and PHP. This was done as part of an ongoing project for COMP2068 
(Advanced Web Programming) at Georgian College in Barrie, ON, CAN (www.georgiancollege.ca). The portfolio includes links to my work, a printable online resume, GUIs for a slider and social media links, and more.

My personal portfolio site used a framework from www.html5boilerplate.com and focuses on responsive design.
